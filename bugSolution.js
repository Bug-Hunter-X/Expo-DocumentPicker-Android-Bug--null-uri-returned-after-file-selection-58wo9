A complete solution is not readily available as the root cause is within the Expo DocumentPicker library itself. This issue is inconsistent and not easily reproducible with a simple code example. Workarounds focus on handling the null case gracefully and including thorough error checks:

```javascript
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';

async function pickDocument() {
  try {
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({});
    if (result.uri) {
      // Process the file here
      console.log('File URI:', result.uri);
    } else {
      // Handle the null uri case
      console.warn('DocumentPicker returned null uri. Please try again.');
      // Optionally: Alert the user, retry, or implement alternative file selection method
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('DocumentPicker Error:', err);
  }
}
```
This solution implements robust error handling, including checks for null `uri` and catching potential exceptions during the file selection process. Consider adding user feedback mechanisms to improve user experience when null uri is encountered.
